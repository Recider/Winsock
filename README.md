# Winsock
Winsock C# implementation demo (including struct sending/receiving)

# This demo is more advanced
Includes more communicative console interface, JSON parser, more intelligent Marshalling and many more!
If this demo is too difficult to you, check master branch

# THIS DEMO ALSO REQUIRES .NET 4.5
Because socket features likes .NET 4.5 AND this example uses Newtonsoft Json dll for .NET 4.5
